1.5.	 Overview (Adam)
This document gives an overview of the functionality of the Testing Center Software. 
It describes the requirements needed for the development process. 

1.5.1.	What the rest of the SRS contains?
The next chapter, Overall Description section, gives an overview of the product.
Which establishes a context for the technical requirements which are noted in section 3, Requirement Specifications.
Section 3, Requirements Specifictaitons, is written in technical terms to explain the details of the functionality of this product.
Both sections are written to describe the Testing Center Software in its entirety.

2.	Overall description (Devyn: Draft) (Jordan: man in middle) (Chris: Final Review)

2.1.	 Product Perspective

2.1.1.	System interfaces
+The system shall be able to look up a student (including picture) based on I-Number. The interface here is to the existing school systems.
+The system shall provide music in one separate room of testing. (How do they do this currently? A cd player? If so do they want to be able to turn on/off music from the testing center system?) The interface here is to the existing speaker in the wall, if applicable.
+if deemed appropriate the system shall provide music to the line as well.
+System shall be scalable (ie desktops to mobile)
+System must be written in a language that is maintainable

2.1.2.	User interfaces
+Upon error the User will be informed of the error and a current testing center employee (who is working at a computer).
+The student tacking a test shall not be able to go to any other program on their testing device (electronic).
+The user interface shall enable a testing center employee with 5 months of experience to check out a test within 3 min.
+System shall be scalable (ie desktops to mobile)

2.1.3.	Hardware interfaces
+The system shall provide information about the average waiting time before entering the line using a monitor (TV).
+There shall be a device for entering the student’s I-Number, connected via USB to a Testing center Employee’s work station/computer.
+System shall handle multiple testing locations
+System shall be scalable (ie desktops to mobile)
+System shall be able to show test results as students leave the testing center

2.1.4.	Software interfaces
+Students shall be able to review scheduled tests and what they are allowed to bring to their test before arriving at the testing center. The interface here is to a web browser.
+The System shall interact with I-Learn interfaces to upload grades. 
+The System shall interact with I-Learn interfaces to upload statistics.
+System shall handle multiple testing locations
+System shall allow online testing
+System shall be scalable (ie desktops to mobile)
+The system shall provide the option to schedule tests.
+The system shall provide information about the average waiting time before entering the line.
+The system shall provide information about the average waiting time before entering the line. +The user will be able to check this information in the school website.

2.1.5.	Communication interfaces
+Any HTML content served shall be compliant with HTTP protical 1.1
+System shall allow online testing
+System shall allow for studnets to specify how test results are delivered

2.1.6.	Memory constraints

2.1.7.	Operations

2.1.8.	Site adaption requirements

+The system shall turn off and turn on by times specified by the Testing Center Employee’s

2.2.	 Product Functions
+electronic tests (including serving of computers)
+Paper tests (including printing of tests)
+System shall allow online testing
+System shall be scalable (ie desktops to mobile)

2.3.	 User Characteristics

2.4.	 Constraints

2.5.	 Assumptions and Dependencies

2.6.	 Apportioning of requirements

3.	Specific Requirements (Devyn: Draft) (Jordan: man in middle)  (Chris: Final Review)
