1.5.	 Overview (Adam)
This document gives an overview of the functionality of the Testing Center Software. 
It describes the requirements needed for the development process. 

1.5.1.	What the rest of the SRS contains?
The next chapter, Overall Description section, gives an overview of the product.
Which establishes a context for the technical requirements which are noted in section 3, Requirement Specifications.
Section 3, Requirements Specifictaitons, is written in technical terms to explain the details of the functionality of this product.
Both sections are written to describe the Testing Center Software in its entirety.

1.5.2.	How the SRS is organized?
This document is organized by explaining the overall description of the software, 
more specifically the system interfaces, the user interfaces,
hardware interfaces, software interfaces, and communication interfaces.

2.	Overall description (Devyn: Draft) (Jordan: man in middle) (Chris: Final Review)

2.1.	 Product Perspective

2.1.1.	System interfaces
+The system shall be able to look up a student (including picture) based on I-Number. The interface here is to the existing school systems.
    -Helps speed up checkout and verification to avoid cheating.
+The system shall provide music in one separate room of testing. (How do they do this currently? A cd player? If so do they want to be able to turn on/off music from the testing center system?) The interface here is to the existing speaker in the wall, if applicable.
+if deemed appropriate the system shall provide music to the line as well.
+System shall be scalable (ie desktops to mobile)
+System shall be maintainable.
    -Written in a modern and popular language with proper documentation.

2.1.2.	User interfaces
+Upon error the User will be informed of the error and a current testing center employee (who is working at a computer).
+The student tacking a test shall not be able to go to any other program on their testing device (electronic).
+The user interface shall enable a testing center employee with 1 month of experience to check out a test within 2 min.
    -Student staff may only work for a semester with limited to no previous computer skills.
+System shall be scalable (ie desktops to mobile)

2.1.3.	Hardware interfaces
+The system shall provide information about the average waiting time before entering the line using a monitor (TV).
+There shall be a device for entering the student’s I-Number, connected via USB to a Testing center Employee’s work station/computer.
+System shall handle multiple testing locations
+System shall be scalable (ie desktops to mobile)
+System shall be able to show test results as students leave the testing center
+System shall be able to track paper tests
    -It will take time for all staff to convert to digatal tests.

2.1.4.	Software interfaces
+Students shall be able to review scheduled tests and what they are allowed to bring to their test before arriving at the testing center. The interface here is to a web browser.
+The System shall interact with I-Learn interfaces to upload grades. 
+The System shall interact with I-Learn interfaces to upload statistics.
+System shall handle multiple testing locations
+System shall allow online testing
+System shall be scalable (ie desktops to mobile)
+The system shall provide the option to schedule tests.
    -To streamline process and avoid a crowded testing center.
    -To handle ADA (disablities) scheduling.
+The system shall provide information about the average waiting time before entering the line.
+The system shall provide information about the average waiting time before entering the line. +The user will be able to check this information in the school website.

2.1.5.	Communication interfaces
+Any HTML content served shall be compliant with HTTP protical 1.1
+System shall allow online testing
+System shall allow for studnets to specify how test results are delivered

2.1.6.	Memory constraints

2.1.7.	Operations

2.1.8.	Site adaption requirements

+The system shall turn off and turn on by times specified by the Testing Center Employee’s

2.2.	 Product Functions
+electronic tests (including serving of computers)
+Paper tests (including printing of tests)
+System shall allow online testing
+System shall be scalable (ie desktops to mobile)

2.3.	 User Characteristics

2.4.	 Constraints

2.5.	 Assumptions and Dependencies

2.6.	 Apportioning of requirements

3.	Specific Requirements (Devyn: Draft) (Jordan: man in middle)  (Chris: Final Review)

3.1.	 External interfaces
+Enable student to view scores and times for past, current and upcoming tests in the testing center
+System shall allow online testing
+System shall be scalable (ie desktops to mobile)
+The system shall provide information about what is required to bring to the testing center.
+The system shall provide information about what is allowed to bring to the testing center.
+The system shall provide information about what is not allowed to bring to the testing center.
+The system shall provide information about what is required to bring to the testing center
+The system shall provide information about the average waiting time before entering the line.

3.2.	 Functions

3.3.	 Performance requirements
+The system shall support 500 students taking a test at any given time (either electronic or paper)
+The system shall support X number of employee terminals
+System shall handle multiple testing locations
+System shall be scalable (ie desktops to mobile)

3.4.	 Logical database requirements

3.5.	 Design constraints

3.5.1.	Standards compliance

3.6.	 Software system attributes

3.6.1.	Reliability

3.6.2.	Availability

3.6.3.	Security

3.6.4.	Maintainability
The system shall be programmed in a language taught at BYU-Idaho.
  EXP: The last system was programmed in PIC Basic and it was extremly hard to maintain. The reasons it was 
  hard to maintain was the fact that not very many people know PIC Basic. For this reason, we need the system to 
  built in a language that is understood by the students/faculty of BYU-Idaho. When the language is understood by these 
  individuals it can be more easily maintained, in the future.
