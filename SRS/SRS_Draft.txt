1.	Introduction

1.1.	 Purpose (Devyn) (Adam: Review) (Chris: Final Review)

1.1.1.	Delineate the purpose of the SRS
The purpose of the SRS is to set forth a specification for the Testing Center Software.  The old system 
  is antiquated and now needs to be replaced.
1.1.2.	Specify the intended audience
The audience is Kevin Twitchell as the Software Engineering professor as well as the Testing Center Administration.
1.2.	 Scope (Devyn) (Adam: Review)

1.2.1.	Identify Software to be produced by name
The software suite we will be producing will be called Automated Testing Service (ATS)
1.2.2.	Explain what the software product will and will not do
ATS will facilitate the entry of and distribution of tests.  This will consist of:
-Faculty entry of tests
-Manage test dates, availability, and closing times
-Retrieve student data from Jenzabar
-Student check-in
-Distribution and completion of tests
-Grading of tests and display of those grades in a manner consistent with FERPA
-Entry of grades into the BYU-I iLearn gradebook
ATS will not:
-Grade write on (electronic or handwritten) short answer questions.
1.2.3.	Application of the software

1.2.3.1.	Relevant benefits, Objectives, and Goals 
The current software is antiquated and fractured.  It is not sufficent to provide the flexibility and 
mantainability required.  ATS will allow for scaling to larger distribution of testing services.  ATS will 
simplify the entry process and improve the faculty experience when entering tests.

2.	Overall description

2.1.	 Product Perspective
In this section we give an overview of the Automated Testing System (ATS). This includes its interfaces, constraints, and assumptions.

2.1.1.	System interfaces
The testing center system shall interface with existing school systems. These systems include I-Learn and Jenzabar. The system shall interface with I-Learn to enable teachers to edit and upload test scores. It shall also allow the students to view their test scores. Within ATS the teacher will have the option to make scores visible to the student or hide them. The system must interface with Jenzabar to retrieve existing student data, including the student I-Number, name, date of birth, class schedule, and student picture. This data will be used for various verifications and system logins as explained in Section 3 of this document. ATS must be scalable and allow for future growth. Interfaces for mobile and desktop applications must be provided. This enables ATS to add new technology as it is introduced. See Section 3.1 for further information. ATS shall have the ability to provide music to one of the rooms for testing and for the people waiting in line as deemed appropriate.

2.1.2.	User interfaces
ATS shall inform the user of any errors within the system. Persons using computers for testing shall only have access to their test through ATS. There shall be a user interface for employees to check-in and check-out both electronic and paper tests. There shall be a user interface for teachers to input tests, schedule tests, and make student grades available to the student interface. There shall be a user interface for students to view their own test results. 

2.1.3.	Hardware interfaces
ATS will interface with existing display monitors in the testing center. The existing Testing Center monitors are at the front of the Testing Center in the entry way and at the Testing Center exit. ATS will also offer a secure connection with employee computers, which may be at the Testing Center or at a satellite office to the Testing Center. Each employee computer in the check-in area will have a number pad accessible to students, who will enter their I-Number as part of the check-in process. ATS shall interface with a printer for printing documents. ATS shall also interface with the current Scantron device that translates paper tests to an electronic form. This interface must be scalable, allowing for one or more printers or Scantron devices. ATS must be able to identify paper tests.

2.1.4.	Software interfaces
ATS shall be compatible with client systems running versions of Windows. The software shall be written in a programming language taught at BYU-I's Computer Science or CIT departments. This enables maintenance to be performed by BYU-I's graduates, students, or other professionals. ATS shall use a math engine to understand math symbols, make them printable, and allow students to add them to their tests.

2.1.5.	Communication interfaces
HTML Content served shall be compliant with Firefox, Chrome, and IE 9+ per University standards. (TODO: Confirm these are actual standards).

2.1.6.	Memory constraints
N/A

2.1.7.	Operations
The system shall have a period of inactivity when the testing center is closed, for scheduled maintenance and backups. No tests shall be allowed to be taken during this time. The Testing Center shall be able to set this period.

2.1.8.	Site adaption requirements
  In the case of the instillation of a satalite testing center, all test results, logging, actions and problems
must be reported and logged in the main testing center system located in the testing center.

2.2.	 Product Functions
+electronic tests (including serving of computers)
+Paper tests (including printing of tests)
+System shall monitor booklet number selections.
    -Track test booklets to save on printing to many and stop cheating.
+System shall allow online testing
+System shall be scalable (ie desktops to mobile)
+System shall scan testing center equipment in and out.
    -Scan equipment into a database that is in the system.

2.3.	 User Characteristics

2.4.	 Constraints
The system shall preform at 100% efficiency for storage and delivery of test scores to teachers and students. 
  (I’m not sure what numbers we should use for reliability) 
The project must be written in a language currently being taught at BYU-I. This will allow for students and faculty
  to maintain the system.
The system needs to interface with both I-Learn, Jenzebar, and the Scantron device. I-Learn provides the online 
  testing environment for the current system. The Scantron device reads in and evaluates the score sheets given for 
  most paper tests. Jenzebar is the governing system of the BYU-I campus and is used to retrieve and store student 
  information.
The system must be available for use through a web interface. This will allow for system access from any location 
  within the IP domain of BYU-I.

2.5.	 Assumptions and Dependencies
The different systems that are assumed to be operational outside of this project are as follows:
(bullet) Windows OS - The system will be developed to work with an end system with the Windows Operating System 
  installed.
(bullet) Jenzebar – The system will retrieve the student data from the Jenzebar system.
(bullet) I-Learn – Online tests will be taken through the I-Learn system. Grades will be posted to the I-Learn 
  system as well.
(bullet) Scantron – The Scantron will deliver its information to the system where it will then be processed and 
  used for test evaluation.
(bullet) The TV Grade Portal – The screen at the exit of the testing center will be operational to display the 
  results of the students competed tests.
(bullet) Printers – Printers will be available to print paper tests.


2.6.	 Apportioning of requirements
As of now the system runs both paper and online tests. The online testing is run primarily through I-Learn. 
  Eventually the goal of the testing center is to move completely too online testing without interfacing with 
  I-Learn. The system will also need to be scalable for use on a mobile devise.
