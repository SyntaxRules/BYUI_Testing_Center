2.	Overall description

2.1.	 Product Perspective
In this section we give an overview of the Automated Testing System (ATS). This includes it's interfaces, constraints 
  and assumptions.
2.1.1.	System interfaces
  The testing center system shall interface with existing school systems. These systems include I-Learn and 
Jensebar. The system shall interface with I-learn to enable teachers to edit and upload test scores. It shall 
also allow the students to view their test scores. Within ATS the teacher will have the option to make scores 
visible to the student or hide them. The system must interface with jensebar to retrieve existing student
data including the student I-number, name, date of birth, class schedule and student picture.
This data will be used for various verifications and system loggin as explained in section 3 of this document.
  ATS must be scalable and allow for future growth. Interfaces for mobile and desktop 
applications must be provided. This enables ATS to add new technology as it is introduced. 
See section 3.1 for further information.
 
ATS shall have the ability to provide music to one of the rooms for testing and for the people 
waiting in line as deemed appropriate.


2.1.2.	User interfaces
ATS shall inform the user of any errors within the system. Persons using compters for testing shall only have access
to their test through ATS. There shall be a user interface for employees to check in  and check out both electronic
and paper tests. There shall be a user interface for teachers to input tests, schedule test, and make student grades 
availible to the student interface. There shall be a user interface for students to view test results. 

2.1.3.	Hardware interfaces
ATS will interface with existing TV monitors in the testing center. The existing Testing Center monitors 
are (1) at the front of the Testing Center by the line and (2) at the Testing Center Exit. 
ATS will also offer a secure connection with employee computers. Employee computers may be at the Testing Center
or at a satellite office to the Testing Center. Each employee computer will have a numpad accessable to students 
who will enter their I-number as part of the check-in process. The ATS shall interface with a printer for printing
document. ATS shall also interface with the current scantron device that translates paper test's to an electronic 
form. This interface must be scalable allowing for one or more printers or scantron devices. The ATS harware must
be able to identify paper tests.


2.1.4.	Software interfaces
  ATS shall be compatable with client systems running versions of windows. The software shall be written in a 
programming language taught at Brigham Young University - Idaho's Computer Science or CIT departments. This enables
maintance to be performed by BYU-I's graduates, students, or other perofessionals.
  The System shall use a math engine to understand math symbols, to make them prinatable, and allow students to 
add mathematical symbols to their tests.

2.1.5.	Communication interfaces
  HTML Content served shall be conpliant with Firefox, Chrome and IE 9+ per University standards. (TODO: Confirm these 
are actual standards).

2.1.6.	Memory constraints
N/A

2.1.7.	Operations
The system shall have a period of inactivty when the testing center is closed. No tests shall be allowed to 
be taken durring this time. The user shall be able to set this period. Durring this period of inactivty backup of
data shall occur.

2.1.8.	Site adaption requirements
  In the case of the instillation of a satalite testing center, all test results, logging, actions and problems
must be reported and logged in the main testing center system located in the testing center.

2.2.	 Product Functions
+electronic tests (including serving of computers)
+Paper tests (including printing of tests)
+System shall monitor booklet number selections.
    -Track test booklets to save on printing to many and stop cheating.
+System shall allow online testing
+System shall be scalable (ie desktops to mobile)
+System shall scan testing center equipment in and out.
    -Scan equipment into a database that is in the system.


2.3.	 User Characteristics

2.4.	 Constraints
The system shall preform at 100% efficiency for storage and delivery of test scores to teachers and students. 
  (I’m not sure what numbers we should use for reliability) 
The project must be written in a language currently being taught at BYU-I. This will allow for students and faculty
  to maintain the system.
The system needs to interface with both I-Learn, Jenzebar, and the Scantron device. I-Learn provides the online 
  testing environment for the current system. The Scantron device reads in and evaluates the score sheets given for 
  most paper tests. Jenzebar is the governing system of the BYU-I campus and is used to retrieve and store student 
  information.
The system must be available for use through a web interface. This will allow for system access from any location 
  within the IP domain of BYU-I.

2.5.	 Assumptions and Dependencies
The different systems that are assumed to be operational outside of this project are as follows:
(bullet) Windows OS - The system will be developed to work with an end system with the Windows Operating System 
  installed.
(bullet) Jenzebar – The system will retrieve the student data from the Jenzebar system.
(bullet) I-Learn – Online tests will be taken through the I-Learn system. Grades will be posted to the I-Learn 
  system as well.
(bullet) Scantron – The Scantron will deliver its information to the system where it will then be processed and 
  used for test evaluation.
(bullet) The TV Grade Portal – The screen at the exit of the testing center will be operational to display the 
  results of the students competed tests.
(bullet) Printers – Printers will be available to print paper tests.


2.6.	 Apportioning of requirements
As of now the system runs both paper and online tests. The online testing is run primarily through I-Learn. 
  Eventually the goal of the testing center is to move completely too online testing without interfacing with 
  I-Learn. The system will also need to be scalable for use on a mobile devise.

  than one test at a time, it is hard to gauge how long the test actually takes.

3.6.4.	Maintainability
The system shall be programmed in a language taught at BYU-Idaho.
  EXP: The last system was programmed in PIC Basic and it was extremly hard to maintain. The reasons it was 
  hard to maintain was the fact that not very many people know PIC Basic. For this reason, we need the system to 
  built in a language that is understood by the students/faculty of BYU-Idaho. When the language is understood by these 
  individuals it can be more easily maintained, in the future.
